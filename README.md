# Final-Project-Javascript

For my final project, I created a POS system using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

I created a POS with 150 cocktails by using API.

By clicking the info button, you can check the ingrediens and recipe of the drink/cocktail, and by clicking on the thumbnail, you will add the drink to the cart.

The total price will be calculated based on the amount of the drinks, as well as their prices.
